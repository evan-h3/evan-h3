# Hi, I’m [Evan! 👋][(https://evan-h3.github.io/)]

I’m a **Computer Science** and **Data Science** student at **UW–Madison**, passionate about blending AI, robotics, and software development to build impactful solutions. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a love for problem-solving — especially in areas like **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**.

Outside of coding and academics, I enjoy singing 🎤, playing guitar 🎸, exploring new foods 🍜, and hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️ pretty regularly.
