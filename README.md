# Hi, Iâ€™m [Evan](https://evan-h3.github.io/)! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Computer Science** and **Data Science** student at **UWâ€“Madison**, passionate about blending AI, robotics, and software development to build impactful solutions. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a love for problem-solving â€” especially in areas like **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**.

Outside of coding and academics, I enjoy singing, playing guitar, exploring new foods, and going to the gym regularly.
