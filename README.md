# Hi, I’m [Evan! 👋](https://evan-h3.github.io/)

I’m a **Computer Science** and **Data Science** student at **UW–Madison**, passionate about blending AI, robotics, and software development to build impactful solutions. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a love for problem-solving — especially in areas like **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**.

Outside of coding and academics, I enjoy singing, playing guitar, exploring new foods, and going to the gym regularly.
